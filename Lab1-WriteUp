WRITE UP:
Lab-1
Team Members: Andrew Okerlund, Noa Kehle

Language: Python, environment VS Code

Architecture: We chose to read the file in and store it as a list of lists where each inernal list was a line of the file.
The reasoning for this was because the dataset was relatively short. Additionally we deemed ability to index and splice the lists
would be a very handy functionality to have. 

Tasks: 
Setting up lab + first 2 search functions: Andrew Okerlund (90 minutes)
The rest of the search functions: Noa Kehle ( )
Testing: Andrew Okerlund (80 minutes)
